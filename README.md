# Analysis of Covid 19 using publicly available open data

The following jupyter notebooks contain my analysis of Covid 19.   

If you enjoy messing around with Pandas and different visualization libraries you are welcome to contribute.



Why am I doing this?
==========


At some point during the pandemic I started feeling like news outlets were not reporting on the things I cared about. I care about numbers and actual data, not some news outlets interpretation. Even worse is editorialized content that always puts a spin on the data to push an agenda. I don't care about any of that, I just want to know what is going on.

The best way to do this is to download the data yourself and analyse it. Even if you don't know programming you could easily import this data into Excel and do something similar.

Since I am a python hobbyist this feels like a great use case for Python Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

I did my best to interpret the data in an unbiased way. However, its easy to make mistakes and if you see something that doesnt make sense or you don't agree with please drop me an email, I would like to hear from you.

Feedback is always welcome as is contributing and correcting data that I may have misinterpreted.

My goal is to simply interpret the data, not inject my own biases.  It's much easier said than done and for that reason I welcome feedback and contributions.  I am not a professional data analyst, I am simply a hobbyist trying to learn.
